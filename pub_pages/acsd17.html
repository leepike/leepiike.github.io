<ul> <li>ABSTRACT:<br><br>
<em>Hoare monitors</em> are a safe concurrency abstraction built around a monitor with shared state and methods that operate on the shared state. While well-known, they have been little used as a concurrency framework in real-time systems. We describe a Hoare monitor framework called \emph{Tower} developed for real-time systems programming that targets multiple real-time operating systems. Hoare monitors use coarse-grained locking across all of the methods in a monitor. In a real-time setting, this coarse-grained locking can be too restrictive, but it is difficult and tedious for a programmer to reason about which methods may safely execute in parallel. Therefore, we present an automated compiler optimization for refining locks in Hoare monitors using partially-weighted MAXSAT. We formalize Tower semantics using Petri nets and show that safe concurrency is preserved under the optimization. Finally, we present a number of empirical benchmarks for our optimization as well as a case-study of a real-time autopilot built and optimized with our approach.
