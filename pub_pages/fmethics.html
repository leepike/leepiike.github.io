<ul> <li>ABSTRACT:<br><br>
Computer ethics is usually motivated by and deals with problematic
decision-making cases arising from the ubiquity and unprecedented power of computer and
information technologies.  In this paper, we address a distinct topic that is
germane to computer ethics but has thus far been neglected in the computer
ethics literature.  <em>Formal methods</em> is the science of mathematically
proving computer systems correct.  Formal methods are motivated by the need for
safety-critical systems (e.g., autopilot systems) that must be bug-free.  We
begin by describing the <em>automatic formal system</em> property of computers.
This property has been studied by cognitive scientists, but it has yet to be
addressed by computer ethicists, despite it having significant ethical
ramifications, particularly with respect to formal methods.  After introducing the history and
purview of formal methods, we argue that normative questions about formal
methods are the purview of computer ethics.  Nevertheless, we take the position
in this paper that these questions are open questions and do not attempt to
solve these problems here.
