    <br>
This paper presents the algebraic and Kripke model soundness and
completeness of a logic over Boolean monoids. An additional axiom
added to the logic will cause the resulting monoid models to be
representable as monoids of relations. A star operator, interpreted
as reflexive, transitive closure, is conservatively added to the
logic. The star operator is a relative modal operator, i.e., one
that is defined in terms of another modal operator. A further
example, relative possibility, of this type of operator is given. A
separate axiom, antilogism, added to the logic causes the Kripke
models to support a collection of abstract topological uniformities
which become concrete when the Kripke models are dual to monoids of
relations. The machinery for the star operator is shown to be a
recasting of Scott-Montague neighborhood models. An interpretation of
the Kripke frames and properties thereof is presented in terms of
certain CMOS transistor networks and some circuit transformation
equivalences. The worlds of the Kripke frame are wires and the
Kripke relation is a specialized CMOS pass transistor network.</li>
