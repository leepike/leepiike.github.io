    <br> 

Runtime monitors have been proposed as a means to increase the
reliability of safety-critical systems. In particular, we explore
runtime monitors for distributed hard real-time systems, such as
fault-tolerant data buses and control systems for avionics and
spacecraft. This class of systems has had little attention from the
monitoring community.  We motivate the need for monitors by discussing
examples of avionic systems failure. We then describe work in the Ô¨Åeld
of runtime monitoring. We present potential monitoring architectures
for distributed real-time systems, and then we discuss how those
architectures might be used to monitor properties of real-time
distributed systems.
