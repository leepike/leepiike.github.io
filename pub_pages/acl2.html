  <li>ABSTRACT:<br>
    <br> A <i>verifying compiler</i> is one that emits both object code and a proof of
correspondence between object and source code.  We report the use of <em>ACL2</em> in
building a verifying compiler for <em>&mu;Cryptol</em>, a stream-based language for 
encryption
algorithm specification that targets Rockwell Collins' <em>AAMP7</em> microprocessor (and is
designed to compile efficiently to hardware, too).  This paper reports on our success
in verifying the ``core'' transformations of the compiler -- those transformations
over the sub-language of <em>&mu;Cryptol</em> that begin after ``higher-order'' 
aspects of the
language are compiled away, and finish just before hardware or software specific
transformations are exercised.  The core transformations are responsible for
aggressive optimizations.  We have written an <em>ACL2</em> macro that automatically generates
both the correspondence theorems and their proofs.  The compiler also supplies
measure functions that <em>ACL2</em> uses to automatically prove termination of 
<em>&mu;Cryptol</em> programs, including programs with mutually-recursive cliques of streams. 
Our
verifying compiler has proved the correctness of its core transformations for
multiple algorithms, including TEA, RC6, and AES.  Finally, we describe an <em>ACL2</em> book
of primitive operations for the general specification and verification of encryption
algorithms.
