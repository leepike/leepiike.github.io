<ul> <li>ABSTRACT:<br><br>
With proof techniques like IC3 and \emph{k}-induction, model-checking scales further
than ever before. Still, fault-tolerant distributed systems are particularly
challenging to model-check given their large state spaces and
non-determinism. The typical approach to controlling complexity is to construct
ad-hoc abstractions of faults, message-passing, and behaviors. However, these
abstractions come at the price of divorcing the model from its implementation
and making refactoring difficult. In this work, we present a model for
fault-tolerant distributed system verification that combines ideas from the
literature including calendar automata, symbolic fault injection, and abstract
transition systems, and then use it to model-check various implementations of
the Hybrid Oral Messages algorithm that differ in the fault model, timing model,
and local node behavior. We show that despite being implementation-level models,
the verifications are scalable and modular, insofar as isolated changes to an
implementation require isolated changes to the model and proofs. This work is
carried out in the SAL model-checker.
