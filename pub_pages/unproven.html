  <li>ABSTRACT:<br>
    <br> 

Interactive mechanical theorem proving can provide high assurance
of correct design, but it can also be a slow iterative process.  Much time
is spent determining why a proof of a conjecture is not forthcoming.  In
some cases, the conjecture is false and in others, the attempted proof is
insufficient.  In this case study, we use the SAL family of model checkers
to shed light on unproven conjectures generated in the mechanical theorem
prover PVS. Specifically, we describe the translation of an undischarged
proof obligation in PVS represented as a sequent in the Sequent Calculus
into an LTL formula that we model check.  The focus of our case study is
the ROBUS Interactive Consistency Protocol.  We combine the use of a
mechanical theorem prover and a model checker to expose a subtle flaw in
the protocol that occurs under a particular scenario of faults and
processor states.  Uncovering the flaw allows us to mend the protocol and
its general verification in PVS.  Our driving motivation is to make the
practice of industrial formal methods more efficient and effective.</li>
