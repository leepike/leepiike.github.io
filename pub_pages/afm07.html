  <li>ABSTRACT:<br>
    <br> 
SRI's Symbolic Analysis Laboratory (SAL) is a high-level language-interface to a
collection of state-of-the-art model checking tools.  SAL contains novel and
powerful features, many of which are not available in other model checkers.  In
this experience report, I highlight some of the features I have particularly
found useful, drawing examples from
published verifications using SAL.  In particular, I discuss the use of
higher-order functions in model checking, infinite-state bounded model checking,
compositional specification and verification, and finally, mechanical
theorem prover and model checker interplay.  The purpose of this report is
to expose these features to working verificationists and to demonstrate how to
exploit them effectively.

<li>ADDENDUM:<br>
In Section 3.2 of the paper, I did not make explicit that the straight-forward definition of 
of <tt>chanSet</tt> in the paper requires that the two transition guards, <tt>H</tt> and 
<tt>I</tt>, must be mutually exclusive.</li>
