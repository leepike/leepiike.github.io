<ul> <li>ABSTRACT:<br><br>In designing, verifying, and validating
distributed systems today, an engineer is often faced with having to
specify a system multiple times. For example, the engineer might
specify it once in a model-checker for formal analysis, in an
architectural description language for requirements analysis, and in a
programming language for testing. By specifying the same system
multiple times, there is risk that each specification has different
semantics, so that the system tested differs from the one verified,
for example. To help solve this problem, we envision an architectural
domain-specific language (ADSL), or a unified language from which
formal models, executable code, and architectural models can be
synthesized. To make our problem tractable, we focus on distributed
fault-tolerant systems. We present the Language for Integrated Mod-
eling and Analysis (LIMA), a particular ADSL that we have designed. We
describe LIMA and its application to case-studies motivated by
avionics design.
