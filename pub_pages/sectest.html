    <br> 
  Control-flow integrity (CFI) checks ensure that programs respect their
  static call-graphs at runtime.  A program might violate its call-graph due to
  malicious attacks such as shellcode injection or return-to-libc style
  exploits.  CFI checking can also be beneficial during testing to discover
  properties of control-flow, as well as at deployment to detect malicious
  behavior.  We present practical aspects of CFI checking, including advantages
  and disadvantages of the following: how to represent call-graphs, how to
  instrument CFI checks, and how to refine CFI checks to properties of
  control-flow.  We discuss two implementations: one instrumenting the source
  code and the other instrumenting the compiler generated assembly, and we
  describe their performance.  Our paper is meant to be a practical guide to
  CFI monitoring.
