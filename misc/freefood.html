<h1>GNKF (GNFK's Not Kentucky Fried)</h1>

<p>
The reader may be aware of <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">The Free
Software Definition</a> provided by <a 
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman">Richard Stallman</a>.  Software, yeah,  
whatever.  You can live without software (trust me), but you <em>must</em> eat.  Colonel 
Sanders 
is famous for his secret and proprietary <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KFC#Secret_recipe"> fried chicken recipe</a>, allowing him
to monopolize picnics and family reunions across the United States.  
</p>

<p>
So what about free food?
</p>

<p>
Fortunately, <a 
href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/shouldbefree.html">Stallman
  has briefly written about food</a>, too:
</p>

<blockquote>
 Imagine what it would be like if recipes were hoarded in the same fashion as
 software. You might say, "How do I change this recipe to take out the salt?"
 and the great chef would respond, "How dare you insult my recipe, the child of
 my brain and my palate, by trying to tamper with it? You don't have the
 judgment to change my recipe and make it work right!"
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
"But my doctor says I'm not supposed to eat salt! What can I do? Will you take
out the salt for me?"
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
"I would be glad to do that; my fee is only $50,000".  Since the owner has a
monopoly on changes, the fee tends to be large. "However, right now I don't have
time. I am busy with a commission to design a new recipe for ship's biscuit for
the Navy Department. I might get around to you in about two years."
</blockquote>


<p>
So I wondered: Is there really anything special about <em>software</em> in the
Free Software Definition?  Can we produce a manifesto to stop Colonel Sanders based on the 
Free Software Definition?
</p>

<p>
The following text is a
verbatim-copy of the Free Software definition and license notification (including 
the original grammatical 
peculararities), in which
the words and phrases in the definition have been mapped according to the table below; 
otherwise, the definition and license are unmodified (in one instance, we had to change an 'a' to an 'an').
</p>

<p>
What results is a <a href="#Def">Free Food Definition</a> and a Free Food <a href="#License">
  license notification</a>  to attach to food products you may develop.
</p>

<p>
The greater philosophical point, of course, is to pose the question, via parody: "Is software 
intrinsically different than other human-created artifacts?"  Or more shallowly,  
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Why do we seem to accept proprietary food more readily than proprietary software?</li>
  <li> While hacking on Emacs, does Richard Stallman wash down his KFC's secret 11 herbs and spices with a 
secretly-formulated <a 
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coca-Cola#Formula">Coca-Cola</a>?</li>
</ul>

This definition is a parody of the Free Software Definition, and
thus covered under the "parody clause"
of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use#Fair_use_and_parody">copyright
law</a>.

<a name="Def"><h1>The Free Food Definition</h1></a>

<p>
We maintain this free food definition to show clearly what must
be true about a particular food recipe for it to be considered
free food.
</p>

<p>
<q>Free food</q> is a matter of liberty, not price.  To understand
the concept, you should think of <q>free</q> as in <q>free speech,</q>
not as in <q>free beer.</q>

</p>

<p>
Free food is a matter of the diners' freedom to make, copy, distribute,
study, change and improve the food.  More precisely, it refers to
four kinds of freedom, for the diners of the food:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>The freedom to make the recipe, for any purpose (freedom 0).</li>
  <li>The freedom to study how the recipe works, and adapt it to
      your needs (freedom 1). Access to the ingredients is a precondition
      for this.
  </li>
  <li>The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor
      (freedom 2).
  </li>
  <li>The freedom to improve the recipe, and release your improvements
      to the public, so that the whole community benefits (freedom 3). 
      Access to the ingredients is a precondition for this.
  </li>

</ul>

<p>
A recipe is free food if diners have all of these freedoms.  Thus,
you should be free to redistribute copies, either with or without
modifications, either gratis or charging a fee for distribution, to
anyone anywhere.  Being free to do these
things means (among other things) that you do not have to ask or pay
for permission.
</p>

<p>
You should also have the freedom to make modifications and use them
privately in your own work or play, without even mentioning that they
exist.  If you do publish your changes, you should not be required to
notify anyone in particular, or in any particular way.
</p>

<p>
The freedom to make the recipe means the freedom for any kind of person
or organization to use it on any kind of meal, for any kind of
overall job and purpose, without being required to communicate about it
with the cook or any other specific entity.  In this freedom, it is
the <em>diner's</em> purpose that matters, not the <em>cook's</em>

purpose; you as a diner are free to make a recipe for your purposes,
and if you distribute it to someone else, she is then free to make it
for her purposes, but you are not entitled to impose your purposes on her.
</p>

<p>
The freedom to redistribute copies must include edible or consumable
forms of the recipe, as well as ingredients, for both modified and
unmodified versions.  (Distributing recipes in makable form is necessary
for conveniently microwavable comestibles.)  It is ok if there
is no way to produce a[n] edible or consumable form for a certain recipe
(since some languages don't support that feature), but you must have the
freedom to redistribute such forms should you find or develop a way to
make them.
</p>

<p>
In order for the freedoms to make changes, and to publish improved
versions, to be meaningful, you must have access to the ingredients of
the recipe.  Therefore, accessibility of ingredients is a necessary
condition for free food.
</p>

<p>
One important way to modify a recipe is by merging in available
free side dishes and garnishes.  If the recipe's license says that you
cannot merge in an existing garnish, such as if it requires you to be the
copyright holder of any code you add, then the license is too restrictive
to qualify as free.
</p>

<p>
In order for these freedoms to be real, they must be irrevocable as
long as you do nothing wrong; if the cook of the food has the
power to revoke the license, without your doing anything to give cause,
the food is not free.

</p>

<p>
However, certain kinds of rules about the manner of distributing free
food are acceptable, when they don't conflict with the central
freedoms.  For example, copyleft (very simply stated) is the rule that
when redistributing the recipe, you cannot add restrictions to deny
other people the central freedoms.  This rule does not conflict with
the central freedoms; rather it protects them.
</p>

<p>
You may have paid money to get copies of free food, or you may have
obtained copies at no charge.  But regardless of how you got your copies,
you always have the freedom to copy and change the food, even to 
sell copies.
</p>

<p>
<q>Free food</q> does not mean <q>non-commercial.</q>  A free
recipe must be available for commercial use, commercial development,
and commercial distribution.  Commercial development of free food
is no longer unusual; such free commercial food is very important.

</p>

<p>
Rules about how to package a modified version are acceptable, if they
don't substantively block your freedom to release modified versions, or
your freedom to make and use modified versions privately.  Rules that <q>if
you make your version available in this way, you must make it available in
that way also</q> can be acceptable too, on the same condition.  (Note that
such a rule still leaves you the choice of whether to publish your version
at all.)  Rules that require release of ingredients to the diners for
versions that you put into public use are also acceptable.  It is also
acceptable for the license to require that, if you have distributed a
modified version and a previous cook asks for a copy of it, you
must send one, or that you identify yourself on your modifications.
</p>

<p>
In the GNKF project, we use 
<q>copyleft</q>
to protect these freedoms legally for everyone.  But 
non-copylefted
free food also exists.  We believe there are important reasons why

 it is better to use copyleft,
but if your recipe is non-copylefted free food, we can still
use it.
</p>

<p>
See Categories of Free Food
for a description of how <q>free food,</q> <q>copylefted food</q>
and other categories of food relate to each other.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes government export control regulations
and trade sanctions can constrain your freedom to distribute copies of
recipes internationally.  Food cooks do not have the power to
eliminate or override these restrictions, but what they can and must do
is refuse to impose them as conditions of use of the recipe.  In this
way, the restrictions will not affect activities and people outside the
jurisdictions of these governments.
</p>

<p>
Most free food licenses are based on copyright, and there are limits
on what kinds of requirements can be imposed through copyright.  If a
copyright-based license respects freedom in the ways described above, it
is unlikely to have some other sort of problem that we never anticipated
(though this does happen occasionally).  However, some free food
licenses are based on contracts, and contracts can impose a much larger
range of possible restrictions.  That means there are many possible ways
such a license could be unacceptably restrictive and non-free.
</p>

<p>
We can't possibly list all the ways that might happen.  If a
contract-based license restricts the diners in an unusual way that
copyright-based licenses cannot, and which isn't mentioned here as
legitimate, we will have to think about it, and we will probably conclude
it is non-free.
</p>

<p>
When talking about free food, it is best to avoid using terms
like <q>give away</q> or <q>for free,</q> because those terms imply that
the issue is about price, not freedom.  Some common terms such
as <q>piracy</q> embody opinions we hope you won't endorse.  See <a 
href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/words-to-avoid.html">Confusing Words and Phrases that
are Worth Avoiding</a> for a discussion of these terms.  We also have
a list of translations of
<q>free food</q> into various languages.
</p>

<p>
Finally, note that criteria such as those stated in this free food
definition require careful thought for their interpretation.  To decide
whether a specific food license qualifies as a free food license,
we judge it based on these criteria to determine whether it fits their
spirit as well as the precise words.  If a license includes unconscionable
restrictions, we reject it, even if we did not anticipate the issue
in these criteria.  Sometimes a license requirement raises an issue
that calls for extensive thought, including discussions with a lawyer,
before we can decide if the requirement is acceptable.  When we reach
a conclusion about a new issue, we often update these criteria to make
it easier to see why certain licenses do or don't qualify.
</p>

<p>
If you are interested in whether a specific license qualifies as a free
food license, see our list
of licenses.  If the license you are concerned with is not
listed there, you can ask us about it by sending us email at 

&lt;licensing@gnkf.org&gt;.
</p> 

<p>
If you are contemplating writing a new license, please contact the FFF [Free
Food Foundation]
by writing to that address. The proliferation of different free food
licenses means increased work for diners in understanding the licenses;
we may be able to help you find an existing Free Food license that
meets your needs.
</p>

<p>
If that isn't possible, if you really need a new license, with our
help you can ensure that the license really is a Free Food license
and avoid various practical problems.
</p>

<h2 id="beyond-food">Beyond Food</h2>

<p>
Food cookbooks must be free,
for the same reasons that food must be free, and because the
cookbooks are in effect part of the food.

</p>

<p>
The same arguments also make sense for other kinds of works of
practical use &mdash; that is to say, works that embody useful knowledge,
such as educational works and reference
works.  Wikipedia is the best known
example.
</p>

<p>
Any kind of work <em>can</em> be free, and the definition of free food
has been extended to a definition of 

free cultural works applicable to any kind of works.
</p>

<h2 id="open-source">Open Recipe?</h2>

<p>
Another group has started using the term <q>open recipe</q> to mean
something close (but not identical) to <q>free food.</q>  We
prefer the term <q>free food</q> because, once you have heard that
it refers to freedom rather than price, it calls to mind freedom.  The
word <q>open</q> never refers to freedom.
