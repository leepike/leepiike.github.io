Dear Program Committee (PC);

Thank you very much for advertising your call for papers (CFP) for the International
Conference on _______________, (20__).  We received a record number of CFPs this year
for which our paper was well-suited.  The conferences were very competitive, and
unfortunately, we were not able to accept your conference this year for submission.
We received __ CFPs, and we submitted to one conference, yielding a submission rate of
__%.

Please consider the comments provided by the authors of our paper on your CFP below.
We wish you the best with your conference and invite you to advertise again next
year.

[The following are sample reviews to be changed for the particular conference being
rejected.]

Overall, I found the CFP interesting, but slightly off-topic for our paper.  I didn't
see many of my friends on the program committee, which seemed to reduce the chances
of acceptance as well as making the social hour much less fun for me.

I am not a member of the PC; I have to question the significance of a conference that
has not yet invited me to be on the PC.

Also, I don't think I can bear to hear Prof. _______'s yawn-inducing invited talk at
your conference.  (Again, I question the significance of a conference that has not yet
invited me to give the keynote speech.)

The conference was located in _____________ during the ___________ season; I'd prefer a
much warmer/colder/more exotic venue.  

Although the topic of your conference is relevant to our paper, I consider its
specific topic a solved problem since I wrote my seminal paper, "________________."

Finally, our paper was about 2 pages too long for your page limit, and my coauthors
and I were too lazy to condense the paper.

Confidence:

Although I thought our chances of acceptance were quite high at your conference, my
tenure review is coming up, and I need a more competitive conference on my C.V.  

My travel funds have run short, and your conference is too far away, and the conference
accommodations and registration fees are too expensive.

This conference seems to pander to Europe/North America/Asia/other, and I doubt our
work will be accepted here.

Finally, this appears to be more of a trade-show than academic conference.
